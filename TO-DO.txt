# POSSIBLE OPTIONS
- Try different "beta_schedule" w.r.t. the "scaled_linear" that is the current used, like:  "linear", "squaredcos_cap_v2", "sigmoid".
- Try different Schedulers w.r.t. DDIMScheduler that is the current used: like PNDMScheduler, LMSDiscreteScheduler, DPM-Solver, EulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler 
- Try applying Quantization over the Model, at the very start.
